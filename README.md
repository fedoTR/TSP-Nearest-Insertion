# TSP-Nearest-Insertion
A raw implementation of the nearest insertion algorithm to resolve TSP problems in a TXT format.

<b>Instructions</b>
1. Load a txt file with the appropiate format.
2. Make sure that your txt files containing the nodes coordinates is in the same folder as the program: 
3. [Example FIle](https://github.com/sjas666/TSP-Nearest-Insertion/blob/main/examplefile/5nodes.txt)
4. Execute first the format.py file and then the another.py                                     
5. **DON'T EXECUTE AGAIN THE format.py FILE AGAIN, IT WILL REWRITES THE FILE**
