# TSP-Nearest-Insertion
A raw implementation of the nearest insertion algorithm to resolve TSP problems in a TXT format.

<b>Instructions</b>
1. Load a txt file with the appropiate format.
2. Make sure that your txt files containing the nodes coordinates is in the same folder as the program.
3. Execute first the format.py file and then the another.py                                     
4. **DON'T EXECUTE AGAIN THE format.py FILE AGAIN, IT WILL REWRITES THE FILE**

###  This is a raw implementation, so, it is not perfect
